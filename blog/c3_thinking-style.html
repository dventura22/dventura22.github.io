        <h3>Abtract Sequential Thinker with Multimodal Learning Style</h3>
        <h5>March 15, 2015</h5>
          <p>
            VARK learning style:<span>Multimodal</span>br/
            (Visual = 9, Aural = 10, Read/Write = 11, Kinesthetic = 9)/br

            Thinking style:<span>Abstract Sequential</span>/br
            (Concrete Sequential (CS)= 28, Abstract Sequential (AS)= 36, Abstract Random (AR) = 32, Concrete Random (CR) = 20)
          </p>

          <p>I have an orderly, step-by-step appoach to learning. Understand this is useful because up to this point, I've followed the curriculum in the order given; reading the sections and then doing the exercise, etc.However, I'm going to explore a slightly different approach. For intance, I like to understand and see the "pig picture" conceptually first, and then get into the details and disect each section/topic. When doing the reading in sections, I feel like I'm missing something, a "link" that I'm not connecting from the previous topics as well as I would like to.</p>

          <p> As mentioned, the linking of concepts with one another is my struggle up to this point during Phase 0.  My learning style I'm sure plays a role with this, as well as the the nature of the curriculum. For intance, I learn better when I work alone first; reading, doing taking notes, helps me with the initial understanding and learning of new material. One observation I've made when doing the pairing sessions,factors such figuring out the other's person "workflow", establishing workable communication, comfortability, etc., affect my critical thinking process and the quality of learning that I do during those sessions. One strategy will be to prepare with the material in advance. I think this will help reduce the "unknown", and help me to ask questions that can help solidify the concepts.</p>

          <p>As my learning style changes, I would like to implement these processes:/br
            1) Keep a journey of decisions I've made. Break them down to understand better how I logically do things.
            2) Discuss my thought process with someone else in the group.
            3) Create awareness of what I know and what I dont know or understand and why when doing the work.
            4) Read more on pragmatic thinking.</p>
