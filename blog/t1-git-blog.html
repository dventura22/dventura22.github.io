      The first week at DBC we learned about version control, Git and Github. So how are all these terms related?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s start with Version Control. Version Control, also referred to as Source or Revision Control, is the ability to keep track of file or project changes. It provides a ‘snapshot” and the ability to go back to specific points in your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The benefits to Version Control is that you can "undo” changes to your project. Say you have Ms. Newbie Developer working on your 3 month code project, and she accidentally gets a bug in the code, well, having version control allows you to go back and “undo” the changes to the specific version of the code that was working. This benefit is very important as it avoids starting on a project all over again. Imagine you had to do that?! Ouch!
    </p>
    <p>
      So how does this version control get tracked? Who does this? This is were Git comes into play. Git is a version control management software. Git tracks your commit- or ‘snapshot”, saved on your project to your computer or server, often referred to as “local” because it’s being use within the constraint of a local environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let’s say you wanted to share your work with others and collaborate on the project. This can be quite hard to coordinate. What work will each individual be responsible for? How do we combine our work? How can we be sure that all the changes will be updated accordingly? Luckily Github does all of that that for you! Yes! How cool is that!? Github is a webpage specifically made to work with Git. It allows users to upload their projects onto their webpage as “repositories” and stores it on the internet. It allows others to “fork” or clone a copy of the repository and work on their own copy and then once changes are made, Github tracks the most current “Master” project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control is essential for any web developer or anyone that wants to collaborate on a project. Next time you work on something give it it try! :)
