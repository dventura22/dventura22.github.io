  <h1>Kitchen vs. Table Mentality</h1>

    Hi Fiery Skippers!

    So after watching the video, my take on the DBC experience is that it's really up to each and every one of us to contribute to the overall experience, during our time at Dev Boot Camp. The type of mindset and attitude that we have will influence how much, or how little, we get for a truly transformational path.

    The Kitchen vs. Table analogy, mentioned by Shereef, painted a picture and demonstrates how our mindset can create different experience outputs at DBC. You can take the consumer approach to just sitting back at the Table, sort of a sense of entitlement to get serviced for what you paid for ("consumer approach”); or you can be a part of the Kitchen and engage your “creative” mind with everyone. Having a “roll up your sleeves” attitude gives a sense of responsibility/ownership, and creates a more interactive environment.

    I am very enthusiastic to be in this learning environment, where engineering empathy is an integral part of what is being taught. Often, soft skills are not being taught. My belief is that it’s as important as learning any program or tech skill out there. In the end, we have to remember that companies want to hire people that they themselves want to be around for 8-10 hours a day, 5-6 days a week. Those who have persistence, grit, and a can-do attitude, will net the most culturally positive experience. This attitude will benefit them tremendously, and will help them standout and become desirable candidates for hire.

      Thank you all for taking the time to read my thoughts! Just as a side note, I want to mention that I have a flexible schedule during the week. If anyone is interested in pair programming, please don't hesitate to reach out. I do have a preference to do my work during regular “business hours” lol, but definitely not opposed to evening sessions, as we see fit.
